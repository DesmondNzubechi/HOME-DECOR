<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Furniture E-Commerce Website with Authentication

This is a Furniture E-Commerce Website with Authentication project! This web application was built using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase, offering a seamless shopping experience for users interested in high-quality furniture. Whether you're a potential user or a developer interested in exploring this project, this README will guide you through its features, installation, and more.

### Project Overview

I initially created this furniture e-commerce website as a personal project. However, after acquiring knowledge in Firebase, I decided to enhance the user experience by adding authentication and several other features. Here's what you can expect from this project:

#### Exciting Features

1. Authentication: Users can easily log in to their accounts or register new ones. This ensures a secure and personalized experience for every user.

2. Add to Cart: Users can conveniently add items to their shopping carts and remove them as needed, making the shopping process hassle-free.

3. Add to Wishlist: Save your favorite furniture items to your wishlist, making it easy to keep track of your desired products.

4. Search Functionality: An integrated search feature allows users to quickly find specific items they want without the need to browse through the entire catalog.

5. Filter by Category: Users can filter furniture items based on their categories, simplifying the browsing process and making it easier to discover items of interest.

6. Checkout Page: A dedicated checkout page streamlines the process of finalizing your order, ensuring a smooth shopping experience.

7. Local Storage: All the items in the cart and wishlist are saved on the local storage, so users won't lose their selections between sessions.

### Try It Out
